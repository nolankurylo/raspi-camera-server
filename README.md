This application uses Node.js and Pug HTML for an Express Web Server and Python for a Raspberry Pi. The purpose of this application is to handle information sent from a remote Raspberry Pi, primarily videos taken by the pi's camera. The application is also responsible for rendering a webpage that displays the information that was sent over from the pi. This project allows for full stack design, MongoDB (non-relational) database and Raspberry Pi (Camera) experience.
